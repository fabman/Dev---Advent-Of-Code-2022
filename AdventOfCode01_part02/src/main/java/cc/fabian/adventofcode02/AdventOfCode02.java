 * --- Part Two ---
 * By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already 
 * realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.
 * To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know 
 * the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. 
 * 
 * That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.
 * In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), 
 * then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories). 
 * 
 * The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is 45000.
 * Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. 
 * How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?
